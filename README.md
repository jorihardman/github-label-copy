```

** Setup **
  * Go to your Github `Preferences -> Applications -> Personal Access Tokens`
  * Generate a token, be sure to save its value.
  * Ensure `repo` is selected as a scope.
  * Save this in a file in your home directory.
    * /home/youruser/.githubconfig for linux
    * C:\Users\youruser\_githubconfig on Windows
    * Note the . vs the _
  * Save this key in a JSON formatted file that looks like this

  ```json
    {
        "personalAccessToken": "15753ef81c66dd7fb75a27e0946cea677fbc192a"
    }
  ```

  * Yeah that's an old code don't think you can go impersonating me.
  * At some point I'll upgrade to using the actual Github client and support all
  of the various OAuth methods.
